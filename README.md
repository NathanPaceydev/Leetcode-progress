# Leetcode-progress
Simple api call of my Leetcode profile's details. Used on the [Software Projects](https://npacey01.wixsite.com/website/software-projects)
 of my portfolio website, where it displays the number of leetcode problems I have solved. 
The script works by calling the api with my user details and then parsing the JSON file.
